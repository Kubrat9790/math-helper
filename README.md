# Math Helper 🧮

Math Helper is a simple and friendly math-solving assistant made especially for students who just want one thing: to get their homework done — clearly, correctly, and without wasting time.

## ✏️ What It Does

This web app helps you:
- Solve math **expressions**, **equations**, and **inequalities**
- Get a **clear answer**
- See a **step-by-step explanation** — so you learn while solving

No tests. No distractions. Just real help with real problems.

## 🌟 Why It Exists

Because most students don’t want long tests or complex systems.  
They want fast, clear answers and to understand *how* to get them.
